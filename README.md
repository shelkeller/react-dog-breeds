# react-dog-breeds
This is a project exploring the dog.ceo API. It can be found running live here: 
https://shelkeller.github.io/react-dog-breeds

This project was built from the template CodeSandbox provided and then exported. It may have weird packaging stuff. I'm seeing an error in the console I'm unfamiliar with, for example.
